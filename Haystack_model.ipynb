How to Detect and Defend Against Manipulation, Deception, Dark PsychologicalPersuasion, and Covert NLP. How to detect and decipher genuine emotions in others so that you can protect yourself from being emotionally abused and manipulated.\\n Growing up, a sweetheart of the neighborhood was a victim of an online scam that left her homeless and heartbroken. She was committed to a psychiatric ward for a few months before she had to be moved to a distant relative. The perpetrators lay the same levels of deceit on the web, but fundamentally, the patterns are the same.\\n Dark Psychology is a study of the human condition in relation to the psychological nature of humans to prey on others. The book, Dark Psychology: The Practical Uses and Best Defenses of Psychological Warfare in Everyday Life was born. It is a generally held belief that the human\\'s mind influences our behavior and actions.\\n The effects of dark psychology are experienced by both the perpetrator and the victim. People who exhibit certain personality traits that are considered dark such as narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism are prone to experiencing difficulties in all aspects of their relationships. Darkophobicpsychology illuminates the dark side of human nature.\\n Dark personality traits have a high tendency that the person would exhibit the traits associated with crime perpetration rates higher than in general society. The biggest impact of dark psychology on anyone is that it produces a strong sense of loss. For some others, becoming victims can have such a tremendous impact on their psyche that it causes something inside of them to snap.\\n A single mom working hard to care for and provide for her son met a man who was basically what she had always prayed for in a man. He was charming, considerate and seemed to love her boy just as much as he loved her. In order to fully make himself available for this young family, he devoted himself to caring for her until his true dark nature emerged. A prominent Minister of God accused of molesting underaged members of his congregation. He claimed he had a mandate to sleep with 7 virgins.\\n Criss Jami: We are vulnerable simply because we are human. Our desires, our aspirations, our quest for living a transcendent life are some of the things that make us vulnerable to predators. But the day we cease to possess any of these things, we become the thing that we are trying to protect ourselves against. When we stop believing, or when we stop caring, we stop being vulnerable.\\n Analysing your vulnerability can help you turn around your greatest weaknesses into your greatest strength. The art of psychological manipulation is part of our nature, but when used wickedly, it is the beginning of a magician’s karmic calamity’ – F. F. Hodge.\\n A master manipulator is skilled at coming up with grand stories that have no real bearings on the truth. Some people are so good at their lies that you almost never realize the lie until it is too late. Deception is often employed in the act of manipulation and is one of the many subtle techniques used in manipulation.\\n Deception is built on the very emotion that is essential for human relationship…trust. For an act of deception to work, a form of relationship has to be established between the deceiver and the victim. Deception isn\\'t always something that is done to others, it is the lies we tell ourselves.\\n Some of the negative feelings we have about hypnotism is due to wrongly held beliefs about it. Hypnosis is psychology described as cooperative interaction in which participants respond to the suggestions of the hypnotist. People react differently under hypnosis, but they are not as incapacitated as they appear. People are brought into this state with the use of visualization and verbal repetition. It is based on the research work of Sigmund Freud.\\n Certain people do things simply because they can. Engaging in crime does not necessarily make one a criminal. For a person to commit a certain type of offence, there are usually certain characteristics they display that indicate this person may be capable of this. For this chapter, we are going to address 4 traits that help you make better choices in relating to people.\\n Some of us are inherently wired to want to fix the people in our lives and think if we love them hard enough, we can bring them back from the brink of whatever precipice they are on, they can begin their journey to a happily ever after. We use reverse psychology in our relations with others and it is not always born from malicious intent. The major difference between reverse psychology and manipulation is that the person who is being manipulated is given an illusion of choice.\\n The most common place where elements of dark psychology are manifest is in our love-loving relationships with our significant other. Love is a primordial emotion that we all instinctively crave and feel loved. It is easy for things to degrade to a point where love is used as a bargaining chip for more power.\\n Sting says that blind faith does not only refer to the belief in one supreme God or higher deity. Faith sometimes creates a blind spot that distorts the reality causing us to make decisions that we probably wouldn’t if we were in our right state of mind. Some people prey on our fear of the afterlife that they manipulate us into getting what they want.\\n The common tactic is to use the name of the principal deity to twists the words that are drawn from the religion’s sacred manual to mean new things that they are making up in order to help them successfully manipulate the people. Another method these false religious leaders use is claiming to have a vision or spiritual insight into a specific need that the victim has. People who place their hope in science are not immune to manipulations.\\n The way we think, live and function can be traced to the influences of our society. Social conditioning refers to the impact the society has on your life as a whole. The biggest advancement our society has made today is in the area of technology. We live in a world where things are done in a flash. Unfortunately, this speed that characterizes our daily lives makes us more vulnerable.\\n Social media is the craze of our time and people have become overnight sensations thanks to social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook among others. This has caused some of us to nurse similar dreams, but until that happens, we are willing to settle for the likes and comments we get from social media.\\n Most organizations believe ambition is one of the most desirable qualities in a potential employee. Ambition is more concrete in its concrete in terms of its concrete aspirations and aspirations. But when other elements come into play, they can be used to manipulate and deceive you. People with lofty ambitions and aspirations are more likely to fall for manipulative techniques that involve blackmail.\\n Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy: \\'There are certain experiences in life that would promptly induce the never-repeated reaction from us\\' Kennedy: There is a long spectrum of emotions that can be triggered by zotions ranging from anger to anger. Kennedy: \"There are some things in life only experience can teach you and each experience leaves an emotional scar\"\\n When an event occurs, whether good or bad, your brain identifies that incident with a specific emotion. This would explain why something as simple as the smell of freshly baked bread can transport you to your childhood. Marketing companies and advertising agencies employ this knowledge in their advertising strategy. Lying to yourself deadens those instincts and opens us to possible dangers.\\n According to a school of thought, humans are more susceptible to self-deception because we choose to hold on to certain beliefs. We hear of the expression wolf in sheep clothing all the time but chose to deny the existence of the threat because they wanted to believe that the wolf was one of them. The truth may not be what we want it to be, but you should not lie to yourself.\\n There are truths that when told with malicious intent can have the same effect as a terrible lie if not worse. Lies have a way of changing you and that change is not always good. Lies that stem from an altered reality of events are not the only type of lies that can be used to manipulate us.\\n Beryl Markham: A person with poor self-esteem and poor confidence can be easily manipulated. Markham says dwelling on the past may not be as vivid as vivid, but the psychological threat of dwelling on our past is just as potent, as we explored the emotional scars we explored earlier.\\n When you live your life in the past, you get yourself rooted in a situation that slows you down or stop you from moving forward. Fear is one of the most powerful emotions that our memories can activate. People who dwell on the past are more likely to be depressed than others.\\n There is a kind of optimism that appears to disconnect you from the reality and that type of optimism is known as known as \\'blind optimism\\' Blind optimism is a form of self-deception that keeps you from taking any action that could mitigate negative outcomes. Being optimistic has a lot of health and mental health benefits, says author Colum McCann.\\n The four walls that imprison us in a web of deceit are the lies we tell ourselves, the lies that others tell us, dwelling on the past and blind optimism. Genesis P. Orridge says the four walls are a facet of the false realities that entraps us and on their own, they can be devastating.\\n Emotions are to a manipulator what a wand is to a magician. Emotions can make you vulnerable, but with the right application of knowledge, your emotions can equally become your greatest ally in this battle. Instead of trying to numb your emotions, we can exert more control over them and use them to help us grow as individuals.\\n Heath L. Buckmaster outlines five ways to break free from self-deception. He says it\\'s not about becoming a new person, but becoming the person you already are meant to be, and already are but don’t know how to be. To break free, the first step is confronting the situation and breaking off any illusions.\\n When confronted with the truth of the situation, a part of you clings to the comfort that those illusions are comforting you. Acting irrationally can complicate situations more than they already are. The intensity of the emotions we have experienced may cause us to want to go into denial. The more you delay taking action, the deeper and faster your denial sets in.\\n When you discover you have been consistently lied to, you become emotionally scarred so, the question of leaving the situation unscathed becomes mute. When a person has been caught in the web of deceit, they want to do everything to protect themselves. The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Don’t wait for good things to happen to you, you will fill the world with hope.\\n Tom Petri\\'s book is dedicated to helping people sieve through the lies and manipulations of people who live in the dark. Petri says the most trouble is the attempted cover-up that gets people in trouble. After confronting the perpetrator and taking the necessary steps to leave the situation, you need to commence the healing process promptly.\\n The duration of the relationship you may have had with them does not guarantee that they are incapable of hurting you. Sometimes, the times spent with you helps cement your trust in them making you more vulnerable and more susceptible to their charms. The best you can do is look out for the signs I mentioned and keep an open mind.\\n Stephen Richards has written a book about how to mend your relationship with someone you have been in a relationship with that person. He says it is not your fault and you need to remind yourself that the past is not something you can change. The best thing to do is pick up the lessons you have learned and shape them into principles to live by, he says.\\n Dr. Joyce Brothers explains how to deal with your inner demons and self-discovery. She says the healing process is only completed when you let go and trust your gut instincts. Dr. Brothers: When dealing with the forces of dark psychology, your primary defense is your instinct.\\n The first step to connecting with your instinct is decluttering your mind with meditation. The next part involves trusting yourself and trusting others. If money and material wealth are at the forefront of your mind, you may not be able to see past them. If you are constantly thinking on material wealth, you will only attract people who think the same way as you.\\n When you have been treated badly in life, you naturally want to shut yourself in and close yourself off to people. But, never believe for one moment that people do not get their comeuppance. Instead, turn the situation around by choosing to end the pain cycle with you.\\n If you have been hurt by people, this book is meant to help you with the process of healing. Nothing in life is ever concluded. Love hard, smile more and most importantly, let go. Life is too precious and too wonderful to live it any other way.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'summerization.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '332988c91a196fba032048cc67042373'}>]\n"
