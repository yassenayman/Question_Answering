      "2  Mafia and Organized Crime   For a long time, the term “mafia” has been used as a synonym for organized crime (Blok 2008), and Italian mafia has been considered a paradigm of organized crime (Paoli 2003). Nonetheless, the term “mafia” refers to a specific form of organized crime (Finckenauer 2005),  and  the  illegal organizations that  have  been  presented as its archetype include large-scale criminal groups other than Italian mafias, such as the Chinese Triads and the Japanese Yakuza (Paoli 2002). The  main  trait  that distinguishes  mafia groups  from other  criminal  organiza-tions is their political dimension. Although actively  involved  in illegal market ac-tivities, mafia groups cannot be reduced to these activities (Paoli 2002) nor is their internal configuration  the  consequence  of  their  participation  in  illegal  businesses (van  Duyne  1997).  Besides  the  provision  of  illegal  goods  and  services  and  the maximization  of  profits, mafia  groups  aim  at  exercising political  dominion  over the areas  where  their  members  live and  where most  of  their  illegal  activities are conducted. The control over the territory is guaranteed by a generalized system of extortion,  which  also allows  mafia  organizations  to  increase their  income (Paoli 2003). Another peculiarity of mafia groups is their internal configuration. Despite var-iations, mafia organizations are characterized by the presence of government bod-ies that coordinate the activities  and  regulate  the  relationships  among  their mem-ber. Symbols and rituals, including a ceremony of affiliation, promote the creation of ties of brotherhood among the members of the organization, who become “men of honor” and are subject to the duty of silence (Paoli 2003). Italian Mafias   The  first  comprehensive  study  of  the  mafia  was  published in  1876  by  Leopoldo Franchetti (1974), who described  it as an extralegal  social system, namely, a spe-cific  and  socially  accepted  way  of  exercising  violence  to  solve  conflicts.  After Franchetti’s  work,  different  ways  of  conceptualizing  the  mafia  have  been  pro-posed over  the  time,  emphasizing  either the cultural or  the organizational  factors (Sciarrone 2009). The  cultural  approach  describes the  mafia as an attitude, a sub-culture typical of certain areas of Southern Italy, rather than a  formal organization (Hess 1973), although organizational factors have also been considered by analyz-ing  the  network  of  family, friendship,  and business  relations  of  mafia  members (Blok 1988; Schneider  and  Schneider  1976).  The  organizational approach  instead emphasizes the internal configuration of  mafia  groups  and  describes  them  as  for-mal organizations with articulated structures and a set of symbols and rituals. The depiction of mafia organizations  as criminal associations can also  be  found in the Italian penal code, where Article  416bis  describes  the  mafia as  a  specific type of criminal organization and lists the main features of mafia groups. \n",
      "3 In the  mid-1980s, the  focus shifted from cultural and organizational aspects to the illegal activities carried out by criminal organizations, and the mafia was con-ceptualized  as  an  enterprise.  According  to  Pino  Arlacchi  (1988),  between  the 1950s and  the  1960s,  the  Italian  mafia  had  experienced  an  entrepreneurial trans-formation and  had  focused on the accumulation of capital.  Other scholars refused the identification of mafia  groups  with business enterprises  and  the sharp distinc-tion between a  modern  and an old mafia. They instead emphasized either the im-portance of the threat or use of violence to regulate economic transactions (Catan-zaro  1992)  or  the  political  dimension,  describing  the  mafia  as  “a  specific economic enterprise, an industry which produces, promotes and sells private pro-tection”  (Gambetta  1993,  1).  More  recently,  the  complexity of  the  phenomenon has  been  recognized  (Santino  2006), and  Italian  mafias  have  been  described  as “multifunctional organizations”  involved  in  a  plurality  of  illegal  activities  and aiming at  pursuing  a  plurality  of  goals,  including  the  exercise  of political  power over a specific territory (Paoli 2004, p. 274). Mafia groups cannot thus be reduced to their  economic dimension, both because they originated before the  illegal mar-kets they  operate  in and  because  their  activities  include  noneconomic  ones,  such as the exercise of political dominion (Paoli 2002).  Most of these conceptualizations of the mafia have been proposed with particu-lar reference  to  the Sicilian mafia, also  known as “Cosa Nostra.” However, mafia organizations  which  originated  from  and  mainly  operate  in  Italy  include  Cosa Nostra  (Our  Thing)  in Sicily,  the  ‘Ndrangheta  (Society  of  the Men  of Honor)  in Calabria,  and the  Camorra in  Campania.  Although  these  criminal  organizations share common  elements, the  history  of the  mafia  “cannot  be  reduced to  a  single scheme  or  interpretation, valid  in  every  situation  and  time”  (Lupo 1996,  p.  26). Italian  mafias  differ  in  terms  of history,  internal  organization,  illegal market  ac-tivities, and infiltration in  the  legitimate  and  informal economy  (Sciarrone  2009), and they thus need to be discussed separately. Cosa Nostra The term “mafia” first appeared in 1865 in a report by the then-prefect of Palermo Filippo Gualterio, who used it to refer to Sicilian criminal  groups.  Only  20  years later, the same term was adopted in the United States to refer to a criminal organi-zation of Italian origins. The same organization  was also  referred  to  as  “La  Cosa Nostra,” as Joseph  Valachi  testified  in  1963 before  the  Permanent  Subcommittee on  Investigations  of  the US  Senate  Committee  on  Government  Operations.  The same term  has  also  been adopted  by  Sicilian  mafiosi, together  with other names, such as “Onorata Societa`” (Honored Society) (Lupo 1996). Evidence of antecedents of Cosa Nostra in Sicily can be found starting from the second half of the  nineteenth century, although only in the  1920s, the Italian gov-ernment  ordered  a  systematic  repression  of  Sicilian  mafia  groups.  After  World War II, Cosa  Nostra  extended  its power,  mainly  by  expanding from the country-\n",
      "4  side into  the largest cities and infiltrating into  the public construction industry. In the mid-1970s, the Sicilian mafia entered the illicit drug market further increasing its power and profits, until the beginning  of  the  1990s.  In  1992–1993, the killing of the state  prosecutors  Giovanni Falcone  and  Paolo Borsellino  was  followed  by an intensification of law enforcement  repression.  As  a  consequence,  Cosa  Nostra adopted  the  so-called  “strategia  dell’inabissamento”  (sinking  strategy),  aimed  at reducing  its  visibility  and  thus the  attention  from law  enforcement agencies  by minimizing violence. However, this strategy also  led  mafia  groups  to  concentrate their illegal activities in Sicily, mainly focusing on extortion and infiltration in the legitimate economy (Lupo 1996; Savona 2012). The  internal  structure  of  Cosa  Nostra  has  not  changed  since  the  1950s.  It  is composed of a number of  cosche  or families. Each cosca controls a specific terri-tory, and a boss,  who is elected  by the  affiliates,  is in charge of its management. His counselors are also elected by the affiliates and assist the boss in his decisions. The hierarchical structure of the cosche, the direct election of the high-ranking po-sitions,  and  the frequent  turnover guarantee  the  cohesion  of  the  group and  help strengthen the ties of brotherhood among mafia members. In 1957, a  Commission was  also  created  to  regulate the  relationships  among  the  different  families.  The meetings were attended by representatives of the mandamenti,  namely,  groups  of three or four families. The Commission had the aim of settling disputes, sanction-ing violations and taking any decision related to the use of violence, whereas each cosca was still autonomous in doing business (Paoli 2003). The intensification of the law enforcement repression since the early 1990s and the arrest  of  Bernardo Provenzano, the  latest  chief  of Cosa  Nostra,  in  2006 have considerably  weakened  the Sicilian  mafia,  which has  experienced  a strong  reor-ganization process.  However,  despite  the undergoing  crisis,  the  organization  can still rely on a widespread network of entrepreneurs and politicians that ensure Co-sa Nostra  the ability to commit extortion and infiltrate  into  the Sicilian legitimate economy (DIA 2010). The ‘Ndrangheta Evidence of the  presence  of  the  ‘Ndrangheta  in  Calabria  dates  back  to  the end of the  nineteenth  century,  although  the  term  “‘ndrangheta”  has  been  consistently used only since the 1960s. Different names instead appear in the first judicial doc-uments, such  as  “mafia”  or “camorra” –  which  were used to refer to Sicilian and Neapolitan  mafia  organizations  – or  “onorata  societa`”  (honored  society)  and “picciotteria”  (Paoli  2003).  The  limited violence  and the  fact  that it  was consid-ered outdated  in  comparison  to Cosa Nostra and the  Camorra  made  law enforce-ment  agencies  and  scholars  not  to  pay  too  much  attention  to  the  ‘Ndrangheta (Ciconte 2011). Today  the Calabrian mafia is  instead  considered  the most power-ful among Italian criminal organizations and the most involved in drug trafficking, and in June 2008, it was included into the US Treasury Department Office of For-\n",
      "5 eign Asset  Control (OFAC) Foreign Drug Kingpin  list  (U.S.  Department of  State 2011). The ‘Ndrangheta is organized in cosche or ‘ndrine which are usually formed by the members  of the same family and exercise their influence over a specific terri-tory  according  to the  arrangements  made  with  the  other  families.  The fact  that members of the ‘ndrine are bonded by kin ties  guarantees secrecy and trust (Paoli 2003).  Within  each  ‘ndrina,  specific tasks  are also  assigned to  the  affiliates,  ac-cording to their formal rank in the organization. A two-level hierarchical structure is present;  low-level  affiliates  are  referred  to  as  members  of  the  societa` minore (lower society), whereas bosses are part of the societa` maggiore (higher society). Within  both  the  societa`, a  long  series  of  different  roles  and  tasks  can  then  be identified. The familistic structure  of  the  Calabrian  mafia has  been considered for a  long time a sign of backwardness, compared with the Sicilian mafia and the Neapolitan Camorra. Rather than being old fashioned, this type of structure guarantees a high degree of  cohesion among its members and minimizes  the risk of defections. The number of defectors has indeed always been lower than that of other Italian mafia groups (CPA 2008; Ciconte 2011). The internal cohesion is also guaranteed  by  a set of formal rules, an extensive use of rituals and symbols, and strong barriers to entry. As in  Cosa  Nostra,  an  affiliation ceremony or  battesimo is indeed required for a new affiliate to be appointed and become a “man of honor” (Paoli 2004).  For a  long time, the ‘Ndrangheta was conceived as a confederation of families without  a  coordinating  body  which establishes  common  rules  in  order  to  avoid conflicts among the cosche. This idea of the ‘Ndrangheta  as an horizontal organi-zation started to be reexamined in the 1990s and has been abandoned when the ex-istence of a  collective  body  (Crimine or  Provincia) entitled to  establish  common rules and settle disputes emerged from recent criminal investigations (TrMi 2010). However, despite the presence of a collective body, each family enjoys a monopo-ly on  its  territory and  the  autonomous running  of  illegal  activities,  even though a collaboration among different  cosche is frequent, especially for  the  trafficking  of drugs (Ciconte 2011). The  power of  the  Calabrian  mafia also  comes  from  its ramifications,  both  in other Italian  regions  and  abroad. In  the  last  decades, the  ‘Ndrangheta has indeed created outposts both in Central and Northern Italy and in foreign countries, where it has developed  an  extensive  network of contacts  to  facilitate  its involvement in illegal market  activities.  Kin ties maintain their  importance  in the  internal organi-zation of the  ‘ndrine also  outside  Calabria, since  they  allow for  a  quick replace-ment of affiliates in case of arrests by law enforcement agencies. However, in ad-dition to mafia associates,  ‘Ndrangheta  groups resort to  other  individuals  outside the organization  and can rely on an  extended  network of contacts with  both com-mon criminals and legal entrepreneurs and politicians (CPA 2008; Ciconte 2011). \n",
      "6  The Camorra The Camorra refers to a variety of  independent  criminal  groups  and  gangs  which conduct their illegal activities in Campania. These criminal groups – unlike Sicili-an and Calabrian ones – vary considerably from long-lasting family businesses to gangs  developed  around  charismatic  leaders,  often  in  competition  among  each other (Paoli 2004).  First mentions of the Camorra as a criminal organization can be found in police records which date back to the early nineteenth century, when written statutes de-scribing symbols  and  rituals,  as well as  signs  of  the presence  of  stable  coordina-tion  mechanisms,  were found  (Behan 1996).  Although  most  symbols  and  rituals have been  maintained,  the Campanian underworld  has  changed, and  the  contem-porary Camorra has turned into a different criminal organization. In the 1960s, the Camorra groups entered the tobacco and later the drug market, making large prof-its which were then invested both in the same illegal markets and in the legitimate economy, dealing  mainly  with public  sector  contracts  (Paoli 2004).  With  the de-velopment of the  contraband  industry, competition among rival groups  increased, as well as their dynamism and the territorial control (Behan 1996). The presence of a stable mechanism that coordinates the activities of the differ-ent groups and settles disputes among them no longer exists, making wars against rival  gangs  more  likely  to  occur  than  in  Sicily  and  Calabria  (Paoli  2004;  DIA 2010). The Camorra is indeed horizontally organized,  with criminal groups form-ing temporary alliances and maintaining their autonomy (Barbagallo 2010). As for Cosa  Nostra  and  the  ‘Ndrangheta,  the  direct physical  control  over a  territory  is fundamental  for  Camorra  groups.  “Once  this  control  is  won,  criminal  gangs  can not  only  extend  their  protection  rackets,  illegal  gambling,  usury,  cigarette,  and drug trading;  they can  begin  to  become power  brokers,  mediating  between ordi-nary people and ruling politicians” (Behan 1996, p. 110). The heterogeneity of criminal groups and gangs which populate the Campanian underworld is reflected upon the illegal activities they conduct. Smaller groups are mostly involved in the supply of illegal goods and services, such as extortion, loan sharking, drug  trafficking,  counterfeiting,  exploitation  of  prostitution,  and  illegal gambling; the  most powerful and  longlasting  groups  combine  these illegal activi-ties  with  infiltration  into  the  legitimate  economy  and  the  public  administration sector (Paoli 2004; DIA 2010). Illegal Activities   Extortion and  protection constitute  the core  business of  Italian  mafias. Although extortion is not as profitable as other illegal activities, such as usury, drug traffick-ing, or  infiltration  in the public sector contracts, it does  not  require  any initial in-vestment, and it can be carried out without high risks or high managing costs. Be-\n",
      "7 sides being a source of profit, it allows mafia groups to gain control over a specific territory and thus exercise political power in that area, as well as it enables them to establish contacts with  legal  entrepreneurs  and penetrate into the legitimate econ-omy. The  sum  that  legal  entrepreneurs  are  forced to pay is  usually  calculated on the basis of their legal profits, so to encourage their compliance and minimize the risk of reporting to law enforcement  agencies.  In  some cases, however, extortion is  also  exploited  by  mafia  groups  to  take possession  of  profitable  businesses by forcing entrepreneurs to  undersell  their  company  when  they are no longer able to handle mafia organization’s request of money (Paoli 2003; Savona 2012). Extortion can take shape in different ways. The most common one involves the request of money in exchange for protection. However, mafia groups also resort to “indirect extortion” (Sciarrone 2009, p. 76). In this case, the Mafiosi establish spe-cial relationships with a  selected  number  of  legal entrepreneurs, and they ask  for materials  or  services  normally  provided  by  the  entrepreneurs’  businesses  in  ex-change for  protection.  Another  form  of  indirect extortion  involves the  request  to hire affiliates or other people related to mafia members. By giving suggestions for hiring, mafia  groups create new jobs  for those who accept their presence and col-laborate with them,  and  thus  increase  the collusive behavior  within their commu-nities (Sciarrone 2009). Whereas  extortion  is common  to  all Italian  mafia  organizations,  some differ-ences  emerge  with  regard to  their  presence  in  illegal  markets  and  the  way  they conduct their criminal activities. These differences depend on the history and  cul-ture of the  three  mafia  groups,  as  well  as their internal organization and  their ex-pertise. These three factors – historical and cultural background, organization, and expertise – provide an explanation for the involvement of the ‘Ndrangheta and the Camorra in drug trafficking, an illegal business formerly run by Cosa Nostra. The same factors also explain the involvement of the Camorra in counterfeiting and in the illegal traffic in waste. The Neapolitan mafia has indeed exploited the need for new places for waste disposal and the inefficiency of the public administration and corrupt politicians to  enter  the market, whereas the  lack  of  the  same combination of criminal  opportunities  in Sicily and  Calabria  have prevented  Cosa  Nostra and the ‘Ndrangheta to do the same (Savona 2012). Together  with  extortion,  drug  trafficking  is  among  the most  profitable  illegal activities  conducted  by  mafia  organizations,  and  it  is  carried  out in  coexistence with other criminal groups. Indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s, mafia groups tried do gain the monopoly of the drug market both in their traditional communities and in some  Italian  cities, enforcing  retailers  to  buy  solely  from  them, but  they  never succeeded in  controlling  the  whole exchange of drugs in an entire city  or even in one  neighborhood,  except  for  a  few  mafia  strongholds  in  southern  Italy  (Paoli 2004; DIA 2010).  The  ‘Ndrangheta  is particularly  active in  the  illegal drug  market  since  1980s, when the Calabrian  mafia  has  succeeded in entering this profitable  market  partly at the expense  of  Cosa  Nostra,  whose  members  were no  longer  considered  trust-worthy interlocutors, especially by South American drug producers. Among drug trafficking  activities,  the ‘Ndrangheta  is  mainly involved  in  the  importation and \n",
      "8  wholesale  distribution  of  drugs,  especially  cocaine  and  heroin.  The  position  of strength of ‘Ndrangheta families in the illegal  drug  market  is  guaranteed  by their extensive network of  contacts  in  Center and Northern Italy, both with their  affili-ates and with external drug dealers. In the last decades, the Calabrian mafia has al-so  created  outposts  in  foreign  countries  which  serve  as transit  countries for  the smuggling of drugs (CPA 2008; DIA 2010; Ciconte 2011). The illegal activities mafias are involved in are not limited to the trafficking of drugs. Other illegal goods are provided by the Italian criminal organizations, such as firearms and counterfeited products. Mafia groups are also involved in the illicit traffic  in  waste, illicit  gambling,  loan sharking,  frauds,  as well  as  robberies and homicides (DIA 2010). The large profits are then invested both in the illegal mar-kets and in the legitimate economy. Infiltration of the Legitimate Economy   The infiltration of mafia organizations in  the  legitimate economy “has to  do with the very nature of Italian  mafia  groups  and  their claim to exercise  a  political  do-minion  within  their  communities”  (Paoli  2004, p.  284).  Extortion  allows  mafia groups  to  achieve  an  indirect control  of  companies,  by  forcing  them to  pay for protection  services,  hire specific  people,  or  supply materials  or  services.  Invest-ments in  the  legitimate  economy  allow mafia organizations to extend their politi-cal dominion by infiltrating into and controlling legitimate economic sectors. The management of legal companies is indeed a way mafias can create new job oppor-tunities and extend their power within their communities, as well as establish rela-tionships  with  legal  entrepreneurs  and politicians.  Also, the  large illegal  profits generated from illegal  activities  cannot be completely reinvested in the  same ille-gal  markets.  The  management  of  legal  companies  thus  enables  the  mafiosi  to launder part of their  money  and  make even more profits from investments  in  the legal markets (Arlacchi 1988; Ruggiero 1996; Fanto` 1999). Among the  economic sectors,  mafia  groups  seem to favor the public construc-tion industry,  as well as other “protected” sectors, i.e.,  those where the  public  ad-ministration  regulates  the participation  by requiring  a  specific  license  or permis-sion  and  thus  reduces  the  competition.  These  economic  sectors  are  generally characterized  by  a  low  productivity,  but  they  do  not require  specific  skills  nor technological innovations (Sciarrone 2009). Also, they allow mafia groups to capi-talize on their competitive advantages, namely, the constant availability of floating assets  and  the possibility  to  discourage the  competitors  by resorting  to  violence (Arlacchi 1988).\n"

Only  20  years later, the same term was adopted in the United States to refer to a criminal organization of Italian origins. The same organization  was also  referred  to  as  “La  Cosa Nostra,” as Joseph  Valachi  testified  in  1963 before  the  Permanent  Subcommittee on  Investigations  of  the US  Senate  Committee  on  Government  Operations.  The same term  has  also  been adopted  by  Sicilian  mafiosi, together  with other names, such as “Onorata Societa” Honored Society Lupo 1996. Evidence of antecedents of Cosa Nostra in Sicily can be found starting from the second half of the  nineteenth century, although only in the  1920s, the Italian government  ordered  a  systematic  repression  of  Sicilian  mafia  groups.  After  World War II, Cosa  Nostra  extended  its power,  mainly  by  expanding from the country\n",

In the mid1970s, the Sicilian mafia entered the illicit drug market further increasing its power and profits, until the beginning  of  the  1990s.  In  1992–1993, the killing of the state  prosecutors  Giovanni Falcone  and  Paolo Borsellino  was  followed  by an intensification of law enforcement  repression.  As  a  consequence,  Cosa  Nostra adopted  the  socalled  “strategia  dell’inabissamento”  sinking  strategy,  aimed  at reducing  its  visibility  and  thus the  attention  from law  enforcement agencies  by minimizing violence. However, this strategy also  led  mafia  groups  to  concentrate their illegal activities in Sicily, mainly focusing on extortion and infiltration in the legitimate economy Lupo 1996 Savona 2012. The  internal  structure  of  Cosa  Nostra  has  not  changed  since  the  1950s.  It  is composed of a number of  cosche  or families. Each cosca controls a specific territory, and a boss,  who is elected  by the  affiliates,  is in charge of its management. His counselors are also elected by the affiliates and assist the boss in his decisions. The hierarchical structure of the cosche, the direct election of the highranking positions,  and  the frequent  turnover guarantee  the  cohesion  of  the  group and  help strengthen the ties of brotherhood among mafia members. In 1957, a  Commission was  also  created  to  regulate the  relationships  among  the  different  families.  The meetings were attended by representatives of the mandamenti,  namely,  groups  of three or four families. The Commission had the aim of settling disputes, sanctioning violations and taking any decision related to the use of violence, whereas each cosca was still autonomous in doing business Paoli 2003. The intensification of the law enforcement repression since the early 1990s and the arrest  of  Bernardo Provenzano, the  latest  chief  of Cosa  Nostra,  in  2006 have considerably  weakened  the Sicilian  mafia,  which has  experienced  a strong  reorganization process.  However,  despite  the undergoing  crisis,  the  organization  can still rely on a widespread network of entrepreneurs and politicians that ensure Cosa Nostra  the ability to commit extortion and infiltrate  into  the Sicilian legitimate economy DIA 2010. The ‘Ndrangheta Evidence of the  presence  of  the  ‘Ndrangheta  in  Calabria  dates  back  to  the end of the  nineteenth  century,  although  the  term  “‘ndrangheta”  has  been  consistently used only since the 1960s. Different names instead appear in the first judicial documents, such  as  “mafia”  or “camorra” –  which  were used to refer to Sicilian and Neapolitan  mafia  organizations  – or  “onorata  societa”  honored  society  and “picciotteria”  Paoli  2003.  The  limited violence  and the  fact  that it  was considered outdated  in  comparison  to Cosa Nostra and the  Camorra  made  law enforcement  agencies  and  scholars  not  to  pay  too  much  attention  to  the  ‘Ndrangheta Ciconte 2011.

The ‘Ndrangheta is organized in cosche or ‘ndrine which are usually formed by the members  of the same family and exercise their influence over a specific territory  according  to the  arrangements  made  with  the  other  families.  The fact  that members of the ‘ndrine are bonded by kin ties  guarantees secrecy and trust Paoli 2003.  Within  each  ‘ndrina,  specific tasks  are also  assigned to  the  affiliates,  according to their formal rank in the organization.

The familistic structure  of  the  Calabrian  mafia has  been considered for a  long time a sign of backwardness, compared with the Sicilian mafia and the Neapolitan Camorra. Rather than being old fashioned, this type of structure guarantees a high degree of  cohesion among its members and minimizes  the risk of defections. The number of defectors has indeed always been lower than that of other Italian mafia groups CPA 2008 Ciconte 2011. The internal cohesion is also guaranteed  by  a set of formal rules, an extensive use of rituals and symbols, and strong barriers to entry. As in  Cosa  Nostra,  an  affiliation ceremony or  battesimo is indeed required for a new affiliate to be appointed and become a “man of honor” Paoli 2004.  For a  long time, the ‘Ndrangheta was conceived as a confederation of families without  a  coordinating  body  which establishes  common  rules  in  order  to  avoid conflicts among the cosche. This idea of the ‘Ndrangheta  as an horizontal organization started to be reexamined in the 1990s and has been abandoned when the existence of a  collective  body  Crimine or  Provincia entitled to  establish  common rules and settle disputes emerged from recent criminal investigations TrMi 2010. However, despite the presence of a collective body, each family enjoys a monopoly on  its  territory and  the  autonomous running  of  illegal  activities,  even though a collaboration among different  cosche is frequent, especially for  the  trafficking  of drugs Ciconte 2011. The  power of  the  Calabrian  mafia also  comes  from  its ramifications,  both  in other Italian  regions  and  abroad. In  the  last  decades, the  ‘Ndrangheta has indeed created outposts both in Central and Northern Italy and in foreign countries, where it has developed  an  extensive  network of contacts  to  facilitate  its involvement in illegal market  activities.  Kin ties maintain their  importance  in the  internal organization of the  ‘ndrine also  outside  Calabria, since  they  allow for  a  quick replacement of affiliates in case of arrests by law enforcement agencies. However, in addition to mafia associates,  ‘Ndrangheta  groups resort to  other  individuals  outside the organization  and can rely on an  extended  network of contacts with  both common criminals and legal entrepreneurs and politicians CPA 2008 Ciconte 2011. \n",
      "6  The Camorra The Camorra refers to a variety of  independent  criminal  groups  and  gangs  which conduct their illegal activities in Campania. These criminal groups – unlike Sicilian and Calabrian ones – vary considerably from longlasting family businesses to gangs  developed  around  charismatic  leaders,  often  in  competition  among  each other Paoli 2004.  First mentions of the Camorra as a criminal organization can be found in police records which date back to the early nineteenth century, when written statutes describing symbols  and  rituals,  as well as  signs  of  the presence  of  stable  coordination  mechanisms,  were found  Behan 1996.  Although  most  symbols  and  rituals have been  maintained,  the Campanian underworld  has  changed, and  the  contemporary Camorra has turned into a different criminal organization. In the 1960s, the Camorra groups entered the tobacco and later the drug market, making large profits which were then invested both in the same illegal markets and in the legitimate economy, dealing  mainly  with public  sector  contracts  Paoli 2004.  With  the development of the  contraband  industry, competition among rival groups  increased, as well as their dynamism and the territorial control Behan 1996. The presence of a stable mechanism that coordinates the activities of the different groups and settles disputes among them no longer exists, making wars against rival  gangs  more  likely  to  occur  than  in  Sicily  and  Calabria  Paoli  2004  DIA 2010. The Camorra is indeed horizontally organized,  with criminal groups forming temporary alliances and maintaining their autonomy Barbagallo 2010. As for Cosa  Nostra  and  the  ‘Ndrangheta,  the  direct physical  control  over a  territory  is fundamental  for  Camorra  groups.  “Once  this  control  is  won,  criminal  gangs  can not  only  extend  their  protection  rackets,  illegal  gambling,  usury,  cigarette,  and drug trading  they can  begin  to  become power  brokers,  mediating  between ordinary people and ruling politicians” Behan 1996, p. 110. The heterogeneity of criminal groups and gangs which populate the Campanian underworld is reflected upon the illegal activities they conduct. Smaller groups are mostly involved in the supply of illegal goods and services, such as extortion, loan sharking, drug  trafficking,  counterfeiting,  exploitation  of  prostitution,  and  illegal gambling the  most powerful and  longlasting  groups  combine  these illegal activities  with  infiltration  into  the  legitimate  economy  and  the  public  administration sector Paoli 2004 DIA 2010. Illegal Activities   Extortion and  protection constitute  the core  business of  Italian  mafias. Although extortion is not as profitable as other illegal activities, such as usury, drug trafficking, or  infiltration  in the public sector contracts, it does  not  require  any initial investment, and it can be carried out without high risks or high managing costs. Be\n",
      "7 sides being a source of profit, it allows mafia groups to gain control over a specific territory and thus exercise political power in that area, as well as it enables them to establish contacts with  legal  entrepreneurs  and penetrate into the legitimate economy. The  sum  that  legal  entrepreneurs  are  forced to pay is  usually  calculated on the basis of their legal profits, so to encourage their compliance and minimize the risk of reporting to law enforcement  agencies.  In  some cases, however, extortion is  also  exploited  by  mafia  groups  to  take possession  of  profitable  businesses by forcing entrepreneurs to  undersell  their  company  when  they are no longer able to handle mafia organization’s request of money Paoli 2003 Savona 2012. Extortion can take shape in different ways. The most common one involves the request of money in exchange for protection. However, mafia groups also resort to “indirect extortion” Sciarrone 2009, p. 76. In this case, the Mafiosi establish special relationships with a  selected  number  of  legal entrepreneurs, and they ask  for materials  or  services  normally  provided  by  the  entrepreneurs’  businesses  in  exchange for  protection.  Another  form  of  indirect extortion  involves the  request  to hire affiliates or other people related to mafia members. By giving suggestions for hiring, mafia  groups create new jobs  for those who accept their presence and collaborate with them,  and  thus  increase  the collusive behavior  within their communities Sciarrone 2009. Whereas  extortion  is common  to  all Italian  mafia  organizations,  some differences  emerge  with  regard to  their  presence  in  illegal  markets  and  the  way  they conduct their criminal activities. These differences depend on the history and  culture of the  three  mafia  groups,  as  well  as their internal organization and  their expertise. These three factors – historical and cultural background, organization, and expertise – provide an explanation for the involvement of the ‘Ndrangheta and the Camorra in drug trafficking, an illegal business formerly run by Cosa Nostra. The same factors also explain the involvement of the Camorra in counterfeiting and in the illegal traffic in waste. The Neapolitan mafia has indeed exploited the need for new places for waste disposal and the inefficiency of the public administration and corrupt politicians to  enter  the market, whereas the  lack  of  the  same combination of criminal  opportunities  in Sicily and  Calabria  have prevented  Cosa  Nostra and the ‘Ndrangheta to do the same Savona 2012. Together  with  extortion,  drug  trafficking  is  among  the most  profitable  illegal activities  conducted  by  mafia  organizations,  and  it  is  carried  out in  coexistence with other criminal groups. Indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s, mafia groups tried do gain the monopoly of the drug market both in their traditional communities and in some  Italian  cities, enforcing  retailers  to  buy  solely  from  them, but  they  never succeeded in  controlling  the  whole exchange of drugs in an entire city  or even in one  neighborhood,  except  for  a  few  mafia  strongholds  in  southern  Italy  Paoli 2004 DIA 2010.  The  ‘Ndrangheta  is particularly  active in  the  illegal drug  market  since  1980s, when the Calabrian  mafia  has  succeeded in entering this profitable  market  partly at the expense  of  Cosa  Nostra,  whose  members  were no  longer  considered  trustworthy interlocutors, especially by South American drug producers. Among drug trafficking  activities,  the ‘Ndrangheta  is  mainly involved  in  the  importation and \n",
      "8  wholesale  distribution  of  drugs,  especially  cocaine  and  heroin.  The  position  of strength of ‘Ndrangheta families in the illegal  drug  market  is  guaranteed  by their extensive network of  contacts  in  Center and Northern Italy, both with their  affiliates and with external drug dealers. In the last decades, the Calabrian mafia has also  created  outposts  in  foreign  countries  which  serve  as transit  countries for  the smuggling of drugs CPA 2008 DIA 2010 Ciconte 2011. The illegal activities mafias are involved in are not limited to the trafficking of drugs. Other illegal goods are provided by the Italian criminal organizations, such as firearms and counterfeited products. Mafia groups are also involved in the illicit traffic  in  waste, illicit  gambling,  loan sharking,  frauds,  as well  as  robberies and homicides DIA 2010. The large profits are then invested both in the illegal markets and in the legitimate economy. Infiltration of the Legitimate Economy   The infiltration of mafia organizations in  the  legitimate economy “has to  do with the very nature of Italian  mafia  groups  and  their claim to exercise  a  political  dominion  within  their  communities”  Paoli  2004, p.  284.  Extortion  allows  mafia groups  to  achieve  an  indirect control  of  companies,  by  forcing  them to  pay for protection  services,  hire specific  people,  or  supply materials  or  services.  Investments in  the  legitimate  economy  allow mafia organizations to extend their political dominion by infiltrating into and controlling legitimate economic sectors. The management of legal companies is indeed a way mafias can create new job opportunities and extend their power within their communities, as well as establish relationships  with  legal  entrepreneurs  and politicians.  Also, the  large illegal  profits generated from illegal  activities  cannot be completely reinvested in the  same illegal  markets.  The  management  of  legal  companies  thus  enables  the  mafiosi  to launder part of their  money  and  make even more profits from investments  in  the legal markets Arlacchi 1988 Ruggiero 1996 Fanto 1999. Among the  economic sectors,  mafia  groups  seem to favor the public construction industry,  as well as other “protected” sectors, i.e.,  those where the  public  administration  regulates  the participation  by requiring  a  specific  license  or permission  and  thus  reduces  the  competition.  These  economic  sectors  are  generally characterized  by  a  low  productivity,  but  they  do  not require  specific  skills  nor technological innovations Sciarrone 2009. Also, they allow mafia groups to capitalize on their competitive advantages, namely, the constant availability of floating assets  and  the possibility  to  discourage the  competitors  by resorting  to  violence Arlacchi 1988.\n"

      "  Mafia and Organized Crime   For a long time, the term “mafia” has been used as a synonym for organized crime Blok , and Italian mafia has been considered a paradigm of organized crime Paoli . Nonetheless, the term “mafia” refers to a specific form of organized crime Finckenauer ,  and  the  illegal organizations that  have  been  presented as its archetype include largescale criminal groups other than Italian mafias, such as the Chinese Triads and the Japanese Yakuza Paoli . The  main  trait  that distinguishes  mafia groups  from other  criminal  organizations is their political dimension. Although actively  involved  in illegal market activities, mafia groups cannot be reduced to these activities Paoli  nor is their internal configuration  the  consequence  of  their  participation  in  illegal  businesses van  Duyne  .  Besides  the  provision  of  illegal  goods  and  services  and  the maximization  of  profits, mafia  groups  aim  at  exercising political  dominion  over the areas  where  their  members  live and  where most  of  their  illegal  activities are conducted. The control over the territory is guaranteed by a generalized system of extortion,  which  also allows  mafia  organizations  to  increase their  income Paoli . Another peculiarity of mafia groups is their internal configuration. Despite variations, mafia organizations are characterized by the presence of government bodies that coordinate the activities  and  regulate  the  relationships  among  their member. Symbols and rituals, including a ceremony of affiliation, promote the creation of ties of brotherhood among the members of the organization, who become “men of honor” and are subject to the duty of silence Paoli . Italian Mafias   The  first  comprehensive  study  of  the  mafia  was  published in    by  Leopoldo Franchetti , who described  it as an extralegal  social system, namely, a specific  and  socially  accepted  way  of  exercising  violence  to  solve  conflicts.  After Franchetti’s  work,  different  ways  of  conceptualizing  the  mafia  have  been  proposed over  the  time,  emphasizing  either the cultural or  the organizational  factors Sciarrone . The  cultural  approach  describes the  mafia as an attitude, a subculture typical of certain areas of Southern Italy, rather than a  formal organization Hess , although organizational factors have also been considered by analyzing  the  network  of  family, friendship,  and business  relations  of  mafia  members Blok  Schneider  and  Schneider  .  The  organizational approach  instead emphasizes the internal configuration of  mafia  groups  and  describes  them  as  formal organizations with articulated structures and a set of symbols and rituals. The depiction of mafia organizations  as criminal associations can also  be  found in the Italian penal code, where Article  bis  describes  the  mafia as  a  specific type of criminal organization and lists the main features of mafia groups. \n",
      " In the  mids, the  focus shifted from cultural and organizational aspects to the illegal activities carried out by criminal organizations, and the mafia was conceptualized  as  an  enterprise.  According  to  Pino  Arlacchi  ,  between  the s and  the  s,  the  Italian  mafia  had  experienced  an  entrepreneurial transformation and  had  focused on the accumulation of capital.  Other scholars refused the identification of mafia  groups  with business enterprises  and  the sharp distinction between a  modern  and an old mafia. They instead emphasized either the importance of the threat or use of violence to regulate economic transactions Catanzaro    or  the  political  dimension,  describing  the  mafia  as  “a  specific economic enterprise, an industry which produces, promotes and sells private protection”  Gambetta  ,  .  More  recently,  the  complexity of  the  phenomenon has  been  recognized  Santino  , and  Italian  mafias  have  been  described  as “multifunctional organizations”  involved  in  a  plurality  of  illegal  activities  and aiming at  pursuing  a  plurality  of  goals,  including  the  exercise  of political  power over a specific territory Paoli , p. . Mafia groups cannot thus be reduced to their  economic dimension, both because they originated before the  illegal markets they  operate  in and  because  their  activities  include  noneconomic  ones,  such as the exercise of political dominion Paoli .  Most of these conceptualizations of the mafia have been proposed with particular reference  to  the Sicilian mafia, also  known as “Cosa Nostra.” However, mafia organizations  which  originated  from  and  mainly  operate  in  Italy  include  Cosa Nostra  Our  Thing  in Sicily,  the  ‘Ndrangheta  Society  of  the Men  of Honor  in Calabria,  and the  Camorra in  Campania.  Although  these  criminal  organizations share common  elements, the  history  of the  mafia  “cannot  be  reduced to  a  single scheme  or  interpretation, valid  in  every  situation  and  time”  Lupo ,  p.  . Italian  mafias  differ  in  terms  of history,  internal  organization,  illegal market  activities, and infiltration in  the  legitimate  and  informal economy  Sciarrone  , and they thus need to be discussed separately. Cosa Nostra The term “mafia” first appeared in  in a report by the thenprefect of Palermo Filippo Gualterio, who used it to refer to Sicilian criminal  groups.

The presence of a stable mechanism that coordinates the activities of the different groups and settles disputes among them no longer exists, making wars against rival  gangs  more  likely  to  occur  than  in  Sicily  and  Calabria  Paoli    DIA . The Camorra is indeed horizontally organized,  with criminal groups forming temporary alliances and maintaining their autonomy Barbagallo . As for Cosa  Nostra  and  the  ‘Ndrangheta,  the  direct physical  control  over a  territory  is fundamental  for  Camorra  groups.  “Once  this  control  is  won,  criminal  gangs  can not  only  extend  their  protection  rackets,  illegal  gambling,  usury,  cigarette,  and drug trading  they can  begin  to  become power  brokers,  mediating  between ordinary people and ruling politicians” Behan , p. . The heterogeneity of criminal groups and gangs which populate the Campanian underworld is reflected upon the illegal activities they conduct. Smaller groups are mostly involved in the supply of illegal goods and services, such as extortion, loan sharking, drug  trafficking,  counterfeiting,  exploitation  of  prostitution,  and  illegal gambling the  most powerful and  longlasting  groups  combine  these illegal activities  with  infiltration  into  the  legitimate  economy  and  the  public  administration sector Paoli  DIA . Illegal Activities   Extortion and  protection constitute  the core  business of  Italian  mafias. Although extortion is not as profitable as other illegal activities, such as usury, drug trafficking, or  infiltration  in the public sector contracts, it does  not  require  any initial investment, and it can be carried out without high risks or high managing costs. Be\n",
      " sides being a source of profit, it allows mafia groups to gain control over a specific territory and thus exercise political power in that area, as well as it enables them to establish contacts with  legal  entrepreneurs  and penetrate into the legitimate economy. The  sum  that  legal  entrepreneurs  are  forced to pay is  usually  calculated on the basis of their legal profits, so to encourage their compliance and minimize the risk of reporting to law enforcement  agencies.  In  some cases, however, extortion is  also  exploited  by  mafia  groups  to  take possession  of  profitable  businesses by forcing entrepreneurs to  undersell  their  company  when  they are no longer able to handle mafia organization’s request of money Paoli  Savona . Extortion can take shape in different ways. The most common one involves the request of money in exchange for protection. However, mafia groups also resort to “indirect extortion” Sciarrone , p. . In this case, the Mafiosi establish special relationships with a  selected  number  of  legal entrepreneurs, and they ask  for materials  or  services  normally  provided  by  the  entrepreneurs’  businesses  in  exchange for  protection.  Another  form  of  indirect extortion  involves the  request  to hire affiliates or other people related to mafia members. By giving suggestions for hiring, mafia  groups create new jobs  for those who accept their presence and collaborate with them,  and  thus  increase  the collusive behavior  within their communities Sciarrone . Whereas  extortion  is common  to  all Italian  mafia  organizations,  some differences  emerge  with  regard to  their  presence  in  illegal  markets  and  the  way  they conduct their criminal activities. These differences depend on the history and  culture of the  three  mafia  groups,  as  well  as their internal organization and  their expertise. These three factors – historical and cultural background, organization, and expertise – provide an explanation for the involvement of the ‘Ndrangheta and the Camorra in drug trafficking, an illegal business formerly run by Cosa Nostra. The same factors also explain the involvement of the Camorra in counterfeiting and in the illegal traffic in waste. The Neapolitan mafia has indeed exploited the need for new places for waste disposal and the inefficiency of the public administration and corrupt politicians to  enter  the market, whereas the  lack  of  the  same combination of criminal  opportunities  in Sicily and  Calabria  have prevented  Cosa  Nostra and the ‘Ndrangheta to do the same Savona . Together  with  extortion,  drug  trafficking  is  among  the most  profitable  illegal activities  conducted  by  mafia  organizations,  and  it  is  carried  out in  coexistence with other criminal groups. Indeed, in the s and s, mafia groups tried do gain the monopoly of the drug market both in their traditional communities and in some  Italian  cities, enforcing  retailers  to  buy  solely  from  them, but  they  never succeeded in  controlling  the  whole exchange of drugs in an entire city  or even in one  neighborhood,  except  for  a  few  mafia  strongholds  in  southern  Italy  Paoli  DIA .  The  ‘Ndrangheta  is particularly  active in  the  illegal drug  market  since  s, when the Calabrian  mafia  has  succeeded in entering this profitable  market  partly at the expense  of  Cosa  Nostra,  whose  members  were no  longer  considered  trustworthy interlocutors, especially by South American drug producers. Among drug trafficking  activities,  the ‘Ndrangheta  is  mainly involved  in  the  importation and \n",
      "  wholesale  distribution  of  drugs,  especially  cocaine  and  heroin.  The  position  of strength of ‘Ndrangheta families in the illegal  drug  market  is  guaranteed  by their extensive network of  contacts  in  Center and Northern Italy, both with their  affiliates and with external drug dealers. In the last decades, the Calabrian mafia has also  created  outposts  in  foreign  countries  which  serve  as transit  countries for  the smuggling of drugs CPA  DIA  Ciconte . The illegal activities mafias are involved in are not limited to the trafficking of drugs. Other illegal goods are provided by the Italian criminal organizations, such as firearms and counterfeited products. Mafia groups are also involved in the illicit traffic  in  waste, illicit  gambling,  loan sharking,  frauds,  as well  as  robberies and homicides DIA . The large profits are then invested both in the illegal markets and in the legitimate economy. Infiltration of the Legitimate Economy   The infiltration of mafia organizations in  the  legitimate economy “has to  do with the very nature of Italian  mafia  groups  and  their claim to exercise  a  political  dominion  within  their  communities”  Paoli  , p.  .  Extortion  allows  mafia groups  to  achieve  an  indirect control  of  companies,  by  forcing  them to  pay for protection  services,  hire specific  people,  or  supply materials  or  services.  Investments in  the  legitimate  economy  allow mafia organizations to extend their political dominion by infiltrating into and controlling legitimate economic sectors. The management of legal companies is indeed a way mafias can create new job opportunities and extend their power within their communities, as well as establish relationships  with  legal  entrepreneurs  and politicians.  Also, the  large illegal  profits generated from illegal  activities  cannot be completely reinvested in the  same illegal  markets.  The  management  of  legal  companies  thus  enables  the  mafiosi  to launder part of their  money  and  make even more profits from investments  in  the legal markets Arlacchi  Ruggiero  Fanto . Among the  economic sectors,  mafia  groups  seem to favor the public construction industry,  as well as other “protected” sectors, i.e.,  those where the  public  administration  regulates  the participation  by requiring  a  specific  license  or permission  and  thus  reduces  the  competition.  These  economic  sectors  are  generally characterized  by  a  low  productivity,  but  they  do  not require  specific  skills  nor technological innovations Sciarrone . Also, they allow mafia groups to capitalize on their competitive advantages, namely, the constant availability of floating assets  and  the possibility  to  discourage the  competitors  by resorting  to  violence Arlacchi .\n"

      "Mafia and Organized Crime For a long time, the term “mafia” has been used as a synonym for organized crime Blok , and Italian mafia has been considered a paradigm of organized crime Paoli . Nonetheless, the term “mafia” refers to a specific form of organized crime Finckenauer , and the illegal organizations that have been presented as its archetype include largescale criminal groups other than Italian mafias, such as the Chinese Triads and the Japanese Yakuza Paoli . The main trait that distinguishes mafia groups from other criminal organizations is their political dimension. Although actively involved in illegal market activities, mafia groups cannot be reduced to these activities Paoli nor is their internal configuration the consequence of their participation in illegal businesses van Duyne . Besides the provision of illegal goods and services and the maximization of profits, mafia groups aim at exercising political dominion over the areas where their members live and where most of their illegal activities are conducted. The control over the territory is guaranteed by a generalized system of extortion, which also allows mafia organizations to increase their income Paoli . Another peculiarity of mafia groups is their internal configuration. Despite variations, mafia organizations are characterized by the presence of government bodies that coordinate the activities and regulate the relationships among their member. Symbols and rituals, including a ceremony of affiliation, promote the creation of ties of brotherhood among the members of the organization, who become “men of honor” and are subject to the duty of silence Paoli . Italian Mafias The first comprehensive study of the mafia was published in by Leopoldo Franchetti , who described it as an extralegal social system, namely, a specific and socially accepted way of exercising violence to solve conflicts. After Franchetti’s work, different ways of conceptualizing the mafia have been proposed over the time, emphasizing either the cultural or the organizational factors Sciarrone . The cultural approach describes the mafia as an attitude, a subculture typical of certain areas of Southern Italy, rather than a formal organization Hess , although organizational factors have also been considered by analyzing the network of family, friendship, and business relations of mafia members Blok Schneider and Schneider . The organizational approach instead emphasizes the internal configuration of mafia groups and describes them as formal organizations with articulated structures and a set of symbols and rituals. The depiction of mafia organizations as criminal associations can also be found in the Italian penal code, where Article bis describes the mafia as a specific type of criminal organization and lists the main features of mafia groups. In the mids, the focus shifted from cultural and organizational aspects to the illegal activities carried out by criminal organizations, and the mafia was conceptualized as an enterprise. According to Pino Arlacchi , between the s and the s, the Italian mafia had experienced an entrepreneurial transformation and had focused on the accumulation of capital. Other scholars refused the identification of mafia groups with business enterprises and the sharp distinction between a modern and an old mafia. They instead emphasized either the importance of the threat or use of violence to regulate economic transactions Catanzaro or the political dimension, describing the mafia as “a specific economic enterprise, an industry which produces, promotes and sells private protection” Gambetta , . More recently, the complexity of the phenomenon has been recognized Santino , and Italian mafias have been described as “multifunctional organizations” involved in a plurality of illegal activities and aiming at pursuing a plurality of goals, including the exercise of political power over a specific territory Paoli , p. . Mafia groups cannot thus be reduced to their economic dimension, both because they originated before the illegal markets they operate in and because their activities include noneconomic ones, such as the exercise of political dominion Paoli . Most of these conceptualizations of the mafia have been proposed with particular reference to the Sicilian mafia, also known as “Cosa Nostra.” However, mafia organizations which originated from and mainly operate in Italy include Cosa Nostra Our Thing in Sicily, the ‘Ndrangheta Society of the Men of Honor in Calabria, and the Camorra in Campania. Although these criminal organizations share common elements, the history of the mafia “cannot be reduced to a single scheme or interpretation, valid in every situation and time” Lupo , p. . Italian mafias differ in terms of history, internal organization, illegal market activities, and infiltration in the legitimate and informal economy Sciarrone , and they thus need to be discussed separately. Cosa Nostra The term “mafia” first appeared in in a report by the thenprefect of Palermo Filippo Gualterio, who used it to refer to Sicilian criminal groups. Only years later, the same term was adopted in the United States to refer to a criminal organization of Italian origins. The same organization was also referred to as “La Cosa Nostra,” as Joseph Valachi testified in before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the US Senate Committee on Government Operations. The same term has also been adopted by Sicilian mafiosi, together with other names, such as “Onorata Societa” Honored Society Lupo . Evidence of antecedents of Cosa Nostra in Sicily can be found starting from the second half of the nineteenth century, although only in the s, the Italian government ordered a systematic repression of Sicilian mafia groups. After World War II, Cosa Nostra extended its power, mainly by expanding from the country side into the largest cities and infiltrating into the public construction industry. In the mids, the Sicilian mafia entered the illicit drug market further increasing its power and profits, until the beginning of the s. In –, the killing of the state prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino was followed by an intensification of law enforcement repression. As a consequence, Cosa Nostra adopted the socalled “strategia dell’inabissamento” sinking strategy, aimed at reducing its visibility and thus the attention from law enforcement agencies by minimizing violence. However, this strategy also led mafia groups to concentrate their illegal activities in Sicily, mainly focusing on extortion and infiltration in the legitimate economy Lupo Savona . The internal structure of Cosa Nostra has not changed since the s. It is composed of a number of cosche or families. Each cosca controls a specific territory, and a boss, who is elected by the affiliates, is in charge of its management. His counselors are also elected by the affiliates and assist the boss in his decisions. The hierarchical structure of the cosche, the direct election of the highranking positions, and the frequent turnover guarantee the cohesion of the group and help strengthen the ties of brotherhood among mafia members. In , a Commission was also created to regulate the relationships among the different families. The meetings were attended by representatives of the mandamenti, namely, groups of three or four families. The Commission had the aim of settling disputes, sanctioning violations and taking any decision related to the use of violence, whereas each cosca was still autonomous in doing business Paoli . The intensification of the law enforcement repression since the early s and the arrest of Bernardo Provenzano, the latest chief of Cosa Nostra, in have considerably weakened the Sicilian mafia, which has experienced a strong reorganization process. However, despite the undergoing crisis, the organization can still rely on a widespread network of entrepreneurs and politicians that ensure Cosa Nostra the ability to commit extortion and infiltrate into the Sicilian legitimate economy DIA . The ‘Ndrangheta Evidence of the presence of the ‘Ndrangheta in Calabria dates back to the end of the nineteenth century, although the term “‘ndrangheta” has been consistently used only since the s. Different names instead appear in the first judicial documents, such as “mafia” or “camorra” – which were used to refer to Sicilian and Neapolitan mafia organizations – or “onorata societa” honored society and “picciotteria” Paoli . The limited violence and the fact that it was considered outdated in comparison to Cosa Nostra and the Camorra made law enforcement agencies and scholars not to pay too much attention to the ‘Ndrangheta Ciconte . Today the Calabrian mafia is instead considered the most powerful among Italian criminal organizations and the most involved in drug trafficking, and in June , it was included into the US Treasury Department Office of For eign Asset Control OFAC Foreign Drug Kingpin list U.S. Department of State . The ‘Ndrangheta is organized in cosche or ‘ndrine which are usually formed by the members of the same family and exercise their influence over a specific territory according to the arrangements made with the other families. The fact that members of the ‘ndrine are bonded by kin ties guarantees secrecy and trust Paoli . Within each ‘ndrina, specific tasks are also assigned to the affiliates, according to their formal rank in the organization. A twolevel hierarchical structure is present lowlevel affiliates are referred to as members of the societa minore lower society, whereas bosses are part of the societa maggiore higher society. Within both the societa, a long series of different roles and tasks can then be identified. The familistic structure of the Calabrian mafia has been considered for a long time a sign of backwardness, compared with the Sicilian mafia and the Neapolitan Camorra. Rather than being old fashioned, this type of structure guarantees a high degree of cohesion among its members and minimizes the risk of defections. The number of defectors has indeed always been lower than that of other Italian mafia groups CPA Ciconte . The internal cohesion is also guaranteed by a set of formal rules, an extensive use of rituals and symbols, and strong barriers to entry. As in Cosa Nostra, an affiliation ceremony or battesimo is indeed required for a new affiliate to be appointed and become a “man of honor” Paoli . For a long time, the ‘Ndrangheta was conceived as a confederation of families without a coordinating body which establishes common rules in order to avoid conflicts among the cosche. This idea of the ‘Ndrangheta as an horizontal organization started to be reexamined in the s and has been abandoned when the existence of a collective body Crimine or Provincia entitled to establish common rules and settle disputes emerged from recent criminal investigations TrMi . However, despite the presence of a collective body, each family enjoys a monopoly on its territory and the autonomous running of illegal activities, even though a collaboration among different cosche is frequent, especially for the trafficking of drugs Ciconte . The power of the Calabrian mafia also comes from its ramifications, both in other Italian regions and abroad. In the last decades, the ‘Ndrangheta has indeed created outposts both in Central and Northern Italy and in foreign countries, where it has developed an extensive network of contacts to facilitate its involvement in illegal market activities. Kin ties maintain their importance in the internal organization of the ‘ndrine also outside Calabria, since they allow for a quick replacement of affiliates in case of arrests by law enforcement agencies. However, in addition to mafia associates, ‘Ndrangheta groups resort to other individuals outside the organization and can rely on an extended network of contacts with both common criminals and legal entrepreneurs and politicians CPA Ciconte . The Camorra The Camorra refers to a variety of independent criminal groups and gangs which conduct their illegal activities in Campania. These criminal groups – unlike Sicilian and Calabrian ones – vary considerably from longlasting family businesses to gangs developed around charismatic leaders, often in competition among each other Paoli . First mentions of the Camorra as a criminal organization can be found in police records which date back to the early nineteenth century, when written statutes describing symbols and rituals, as well as signs of the presence of stable coordination mechanisms, were found Behan . Although most symbols and rituals have been maintained, the Campanian underworld has changed, and the contemporary Camorra has turned into a different criminal organization. In the s, the Camorra groups entered the tobacco and later the drug market, making large profits which were then invested both in the same illegal markets and in the legitimate economy, dealing mainly with public sector contracts Paoli . With the development of the contraband industry, competition among rival groups increased, as well as their dynamism and the territorial control Behan . The presence of a stable mechanism that coordinates the activities of the different groups and settles disputes among them no longer exists, making wars against rival gangs more likely to occur than in Sicily and Calabria Paoli DIA . The Camorra is indeed horizontally organized, with criminal groups forming temporary alliances and maintaining their autonomy Barbagallo . As for Cosa Nostra and the ‘Ndrangheta, the direct physical control over a territory is fundamental for Camorra groups. “Once this control is won, criminal gangs can not only extend their protection rackets, illegal gambling, usury, cigarette, and drug trading they can begin to become power brokers, mediating between ordinary people and ruling politicians” Behan , p. .

Different names instead appear in the first judicial documents, such as “mafia” or “camorra” – which were used to refer to Sicilian and Neapolitan mafia organizations – or “onorata societa” honored society and “picciotteria” Paoli . The limited violence and the fact that it was considered outdated in comparison to Cosa Nostra and the Camorra made law enforcement agencies and scholars not to pay too much attention to the ‘Ndrangheta Ciconte . Today the Calabrian mafia is instead considered the most powerful among Italian criminal organizations and the most involved in drug trafficking, and in June , it was included into the US Treasury Department Office of For eign Asset Control OFAC Foreign Drug Kingpin list U.S. Department of State . The ‘Ndrangheta is organized in cosche or ‘ndrine which are usually formed by the members of the same family and exercise their influence over a specific territory according to the arrangements made with the other families. The fact that members of the ‘ndrine are bonded by kin ties guarantees secrecy and trust Paoli . Within each ‘ndrina, specific tasks are also assigned to the affiliates, according to their formal rank in the organization. A twolevel hierarchical structure is present lowlevel affiliates are referred to as members of the societa minore lower society, whereas bosses are part of the societa maggiore higher society. Within both the societa, a long series of different roles and tasks can then be identified. The familistic structure of the Calabrian mafia has been considered for a long time a sign of backwardness, compared with the Sicilian mafia and the Neapolitan Camorra. Rather than being old fashioned, this type of structure guarantees a high degree of cohesion among its members and minimizes the risk of defections. The number of defectors has indeed always been lower than that of other Italian mafia groups CPA Ciconte . The internal cohesion is also guaranteed by a set of formal rules, an extensive use of rituals and symbols, and strong barriers to entry. As in Cosa Nostra, an affiliation ceremony or battesimo is indeed required for a new affiliate to be appointed and become a “man of honor” Paoli . For a long time, the ‘Ndrangheta was conceived as a confederation of families without a coordinating body which establishes common rules in order to avoid conflicts among the cosche. This idea of the ‘Ndrangheta as an horizontal organization started to be reexamined in the s and has been abandoned when the existence of a collective body Crimine or Provincia entitled to establish common rules and settle disputes emerged from recent criminal investigations TrMi . However, despite the presence of a collective body, each family enjoys a monopoly on its territory and the autonomous running of illegal activities, even though a collaboration among different cosche is frequent, especially for the trafficking of drugs Ciconte . The power of the Calabrian mafia also comes from its ramifications, both in other Italian regions and abroad. In the last decades, the ‘Ndrangheta has indeed created outposts both in Central and Northern Italy and in foreign countries, where it has developed an extensive network of contacts to facilitate its involvement in illegal market activities. Kin ties maintain their importance in the internal organization of the ‘ndrine also outside Calabria, since they allow for a quick replacement of affiliates in case of arrests by law enforcement agencies. However, in addition to mafia associates, ‘Ndrangheta groups resort to other individuals outside the organization and can rely on an extended network of contacts with both common criminals and legal entrepreneurs and politicians CPA Ciconte . The Camorra The Camorra refers to a variety of independent criminal groups and gangs which conduct their illegal activities in Campania. These criminal groups – unlike Sicilian and Calabrian ones – vary considerably from longlasting family businesses to gangs developed around charismatic leaders, often in competition among each other Paoli . First mentions of the Camorra as a criminal organization can be found in police records which date back to the early nineteenth century, when written statutes describing symbols and rituals, as well as signs of the presence of stable coordination mechanisms, were found Behan . Although most symbols and rituals have been maintained, the Campanian underworld has changed, and the contemporary Camorra has turned into a different criminal organization. In the s, the Camorra groups entered the tobacco and later the drug market, making large profits which were then invested both in the same illegal markets and in the legitimate economy, dealing mainly with public sector contracts Paoli . With the development of the contraband industry, competition among rival groups increased, as well as their dynamism and the territorial control Behan . The presence of a stable mechanism that coordinates the activities of the different groups and settles disputes among them no longer exists, making wars against rival gangs more likely to occur than in Sicily and Calabria Paoli DIA . The Camorra is indeed horizontally organized, with criminal groups forming temporary alliances and maintaining their autonomy Barbagallo . As for Cosa Nostra and the ‘Ndrangheta, the direct physical control over a territory is fundamental for Camorra groups. “Once this control is won, criminal gangs can not only extend their protection rackets, illegal gambling, usury, cigarette, and drug trading they can begin to become power brokers, mediating between ordinary people and ruling politicians” Behan , p. . The heterogeneity of criminal groups and gangs which populate the Campanian underworld is reflected upon the illegal activities they conduct. Smaller groups are mostly involved in the supply of illegal goods and services, such as extortion, loan sharking, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, exploitation of prostitution, and illegal gambling the most powerful and longlasting groups combine these illegal activities with infiltration into the legitimate economy and the public administration sector Paoli DIA . Illegal Activities Extortion and protection constitute the core business of Italian mafias. Although extortion is not as profitable as other illegal activities, such as usury, drug trafficking, or infiltration in the public sector contracts, it does not require any initial investment, and it can be carried out without high risks or high managing costs. Be sides being a source of profit, it allows mafia groups to gain control over a specific territory and thus exercise political power in that area, as well as it enables them to establish contacts with legal entrepreneurs and penetrate into the legitimate economy. The sum that legal entrepreneurs are forced to pay is usually calculated on the basis of their legal profits, so to encourage their compliance and minimize the risk of reporting to law enforcement agencies. In some cases, however, extortion is also exploited by mafia groups to take possession of profitable businesses by forcing entrepreneurs to undersell their company when they are no longer able to handle mafia organization’s request of money Paoli Savona . Extortion can take shape in different ways. The most common one involves the request of money in exchange for protection. However, mafia groups also resort to “indirect extortion” Sciarrone , p. . In this case, the Mafiosi establish special relationships with a selected number of legal entrepreneurs, and they ask for materials or services normally provided by the entrepreneurs’ businesses in exchange for protection. Another form of indirect extortion involves the request to hire affiliates or other people related to mafia members. By giving suggestions for hiring, mafia groups create new jobs for those who accept their presence and collaborate with them, and thus increase the collusive behavior within their communities Sciarrone . Whereas extortion is common to all Italian mafia organizations, some differences emerge with regard to their presence in illegal markets and the way they conduct their criminal activities. These differences depend on the history and culture of the three mafia groups, as well as their internal organization and their expertise. These three factors – historical and cultural background, organization, and expertise – provide an explanation for the involvement of the ‘Ndrangheta and the Camorra in drug trafficking, an illegal business formerly run by Cosa Nostra. The same factors also explain the involvement of the Camorra in counterfeiting and in the illegal traffic in waste. The Neapolitan mafia has indeed exploited the need for new places for waste disposal and the inefficiency of the public administration and corrupt politicians to enter the market, whereas the lack of the same combination of criminal opportunities in Sicily and Calabria have prevented Cosa Nostra and the ‘Ndrangheta to do the same Savona . Together with extortion, drug trafficking is among the most profitable illegal activities conducted by mafia organizations, and it is carried out in coexistence with other criminal groups. Indeed, in the s and s, mafia groups tried do gain the monopoly of the drug market both in their traditional communities and in some Italian cities, enforcing retailers to buy solely from them, but they never succeeded in controlling the whole exchange of drugs in an entire city or even in one neighborhood, except for a few mafia strongholds in southern Italy Paoli DIA . The ‘Ndrangheta is particularly active in the illegal drug market since s, when the Calabrian mafia has succeeded in entering this profitable market partly at the expense of Cosa Nostra, whose members were no longer considered trustworthy interlocutors, especially by South American drug producers. Among drug trafficking activities, the ‘Ndrangheta is mainly involved in the importation and wholesale distribution of drugs, especially cocaine and heroin. The position of strength of ‘Ndrangheta families in the illegal drug market is guaranteed by their extensive network of contacts in Center and Northern Italy, both with their affiliates and with external drug dealers. In the last decades, the Calabrian mafia has also created outposts in foreign countries which serve as transit countries for the smuggling of drugs CPA DIA Ciconte . The illegal activities mafias are involved in are not limited to the trafficking of drugs. Other illegal goods are provided by the Italian criminal organizations, such as firearms and counterfeited products. Mafia groups are also involved in the illicit traffic in waste, illicit gambling, loan sharking, frauds, as well as robberies and homicides DIA . The large profits are then invested both in the illegal markets and in the legitimate economy. Infiltration of the Legitimate Economy The infiltration of mafia organizations in the legitimate economy “has to do with the very nature of Italian mafia groups and their claim to exercise a political dominion within their communities” Paoli , p. . Extortion allows mafia groups to achieve an indirect control of companies, by forcing them to pay for protection services, hire specific people, or supply materials or services. Investments in the legitimate economy allow mafia organizations to extend their political dominion by infiltrating into and controlling legitimate economic sectors. The management of legal companies is indeed a way mafias can create new job opportunities and extend their power within their communities, as well as establish relationships with legal entrepreneurs and politicians. Also, the large illegal profits generated from illegal activities cannot be completely reinvested in the same illegal markets. The management of legal companies thus enables the mafiosi to launder part of their money and make even more profits from investments in the legal markets Arlacchi Ruggiero Fanto . Among the economic sectors, mafia groups seem to favor the public construction industry, as well as other “protected” sectors, i.e., those where the public administration regulates the participation by requiring a specific license or permission and thus reduces the competition. These economic sectors are generally characterized by a low productivity, but they do not require specific skills nor technological innovations Sciarrone . Also, they allow mafia groups to capitalize on their competitive advantages, namely, the constant availability of floating assets and the possibility to discourage the competitors by resorting to violence Arlacchi .\n"
